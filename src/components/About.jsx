      <h1>About Food</h1>
      <div className="About-para">
        Everybody needs food to eat. Some people enjoy eating in a restaurant,
        and some people enjoy making their own meals at home. There are many
        kinds of food that we can buy, so we can taste the different styles we
        want, and try foods from different countries. In America, it is very
        easy for us to find special food to eat because people from many
        different countries have opened their style restaurant. If we have
        enough money to spend we can eat many, many, kinds of meals. We can
        invite our friends to try them. It is very convenient, so many people
        want to come here.--Florence In my native country, women usually eat at
        home and cook at home. Only men go to a teahouse or restaurant. I think
        Chinese women still follow the old Chinese tradition and they are too
        scared to look at all the different faces. But over here, men and women
        are all the same, eat at the same table, talk, and play in the same
        places together. Nobody cares who looks at you.--Julie When I was in my
        country, I always ate rice, vegetables, and meat, but now I am in
        America. I had a big change. I can eat any kind of food in San
        Francisco. I like to eat pizza and Vietnamese food, but I hate
        hamburgers.--Tiffany When I came here, I had a big problem with my son,
        because we ate differently in our country and I didn't know where to buy
        everything that we like to eat. For example, the tortillas are different
        in El Salvador. Here I have to make them because although there are many
        things from Mexico, they are similar but not the same. Some fruits,
        vegetables, seasonings and spices are difficult to find. I brought my
        cookbook but I think that cooking here like in my country is expensive.
        Some popular foods in my country are: tamales, pupusas, pasteles (corn
        and beef filling), empanadas (platano with milk). I miss Salvadorean
        cheese, cream, etc. A good breakfast in my country is: platanos, eggs,
        beans, cheese and French bread. When I cook like this my husband and my
        son become happy.--Wendick I like to eat any kind of food. When I lived
        in my country, I lived by myself for my job around 15 years. Three times
        a day, every day, I went to a restaurant. sometimes I went to a Chinese
        restaurant, but I almost always went to a Korean restaurant. I've eaten
        every kind of food except dog meat and snake. But all the time I wanted
        to eat home-made food. Restaurant food is just delicious, but not good
        healthy food--you get hungry fast. For example, a long time ago my wife
        got pregnant. If we went to a restaurant and then to a check-up for a
        blood test and cholesterol test, the test results were not so good. They
        use a lot of seasoning. Now, sometimes we eat out for the kids, but I
        don't like it. No money, no time, not healthy. But my wife complains too
        much. She says, "I'm working too much for food."--Yoon-Saing Well...Some
        eating habits have changed since I first arrived here. I was used to
        eating very spicy food and eating three times a day. Sometimes I went to
        the restaurants in my country, and a few times I cooked. Now my life is
        different because I almost never cook. I eat two times a day (sometimes
        once a day) because I'm always busy. I go to the restaurant three times
        a week and I have tried Italian food, Cuban food, Thai food, and Chinese
        food. I love seafood, and of course, MEXICAN FOOD!--Jorge Because I came
        here just a few months ago and I am not adventurous, I have little
        experience with these topics. It's so different from my native country
        because eating outside is much more expensive than eating at home. I
        need to pay tips for a lot of things that I still haven't gotten used
        to. There are a lot of kinds of food at the supermarket that I don't
        know what they are. I learn about them from the supermarket
        advertisements. I know I can be more adventurous and experience more
        different cultures and open my mind and enjoy life here.--Emily I like
        the American eating style. It it always convenient, enjoyable, and often
        too much for me. I like to go to the supermarket here. There are a lot
        of different vegetables from those in our country. The first difference
        is its size. How big are they? I think it's caused by the soil. The next
        one is color. How colorful are they? Yesterday I bought sweet potatoes
        to cook. I planned to boil those with apples, but I was so surprised to
        look at the cut surface. It was colored orange! I've never seen those
        sweet potatoes in my country. While I was cooking, I was doubtful about
        the results. Finally, I added raisins. That was a very nice dish!--Keiko
        In Mexico, usually the food is fresh. The Mexican dishes are spicy and
        many times they have a lot of condiments. These condiments are sometimes
        stronger and heavier for tourists. One difference between American and
        Mexican customs is we eat three times a day: 1. Breakfast is between
        7:00 and 9:00 am. We take a big meal, for example, 2 eggs with bacon,
        beans, tortillas or bread and juice or milk. 2. Our lunch often is at
        2:00 pm. This is the biggest meal. This time we have soup, salad, beef
        or chicken or seafood. 3. At night we take something light for dinner
        around 9:00 pm. The people always need tortillas with their
        dishes.--Desir√©e I'm from Guangzhou in China. There are many wonderful
        foods in Guangzhou. Eating is very important to the population of
        Guangzhou. Everything must be fresh. In this city, the way people shop
        for food is different from other cities. They might buy as little meat
        or fruit as they can, under 1/4 pounds, because they think if they buy a
        lot of food then they can't keep the food fresh and they want to eat the
        freshest food. I think this is the special thing in my country. But in
        Beijing, usually people don't buy food like this. They buy at least more
        than 1 pound of food at a time.--Simin Everybody likes to eat food, for
        the body and for health. Some people like hot and sour food, but some
        don't. As for me, I like hot and sour food because our country is in the
        equator zone and it is very humid and hot. I like my Burmese fish soup
        with rice noodles. When you eat it you can add a little chili and lemon.
        When I first arrived in America I liked hamburgers, spaghetti, and tuna
        sandwiches and I liked to eat vegetable salads too, but now I feel
        so-so. However, lastly I like my own country's Burmese food we usually
        cook at home--spicy curry chicken with little potatoes and noodle salad.
        Burmese people mostly cook at home. Occasionally they eat out.--May I
        like to try things I've never done before, so I like to try different
        food from different countries. I already tasted American food, Japanese
        food, Taiwan food, Indian food, Mexican food, and Italian food, but my
        favorite food is Chinese food. I can buy all of the food that I want in
        Chinatown in America. People almost always buy food every day in my
        native country. They can eat very fresh food. But now, I buy food once a
        week because I don't have enough time to go shopping.--Li I really like
        Chinese food and I don't like Japanese food. It smells fishy. Since I
        got to the United States I've eaten pizza and hamburger, and also
        Mexican, Thai and Vietnamese food. In my country we go to the market
        every morning and evening because there are no refrigerators. We buy
        fresh meat and vegetables to cook right away. When I arrived in the
        United States, there weren't too many Burmese restaurants or grocery
        stores around here. They now have a lot of Burmese grocery stores and
        you can buy most things. In my country we use our hands to eat lunch and
        dinner and now I use a fork and spoon. In Burma we don't have
        supermarkets so we have to go to the bazaar. It's an outdoor market. In
        Burma most of the people cook at home. They didn't have too many
        restaurants but now they do.--Alice Some American foods are different
        from Russian foods. There are some kinds of vegetables and fruit. I like
        all kinds of American food. In my country people buy food in markets
        most of the time. Cities always have 4 to 5 big markets. There are all
        kinds of fruit. People buy bread only at the bakery. Sometimes they buy
        macaroni, spaghetti, and sauce at the shops. I don't like eating in
        restaurants. I like to eat at home. Sometimes once a year I go to a
        restaurant.--David
